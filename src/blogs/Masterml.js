            <p><span style={{fontWeight: "400"}}>In this post, I will talk about the complete machine learning roadmap for beginners. This post is going to be a bit different.&nbsp;</span></p>
            <br />
            <p><span style={{fontWeight: "400"}}>I won’t be telling you about the usual stuff and courses but will be walking you through the realistic events that will happen while you are on your ML journey.</span></p>
            <br />
            <p><span style={{fontWeight: "400"}}>I will discuss a personal secret technique, which I call the </span><strong>Parallel Conquering Technique.</strong></p>
            <br />
            <p><span style={{fontWeight: "400"}}>One of the reasons beginners get confused when it comes to learning machine learning is that they don’t know what to learn from where and how? There are just too many options for courses, books, and ML algorithms.</span></p>
            <br />
            <p><span style={{fontWeight: "400"}}>I am going to share a set of steps that you should take to master Machine learning.</span></p>
            <br />
            <h4>Step 1: Pick a programming language &amp; Get Started!</h4>
            <br />
            <p><span style={{fontWeight: "400"}}>The first step to start learning machine learning is to pick up a programming language. There are different programming languages in the market, but the most suitable for machine learning are Python and R.</span></p>
            <br />
            <p><span style={{fontWeight: "400"}}>I recommend Python. Why? Because its popular, easy to learn and future-ready</span></p>
            <br />
            <p><span style={{fontWeight: "400"}}>With Python, you can switch domains easily. Python offers popular frameworks like Django and Flask for backend development, Tkinter for GUI development, Pygames for Game development, etc. Here is my free </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfDE2a7MKjA"><span style={{fontWeight: "400"}}>Python tutorial in Hindi (with notes)</span></a></p>
            <br />
            <p><span style={{fontWeight: "400"}}>If you go with Python, you must learn sklearn for Machine Learning. </span><a href="https://scikit-learn.org/"><span style={{fontWeight: "400"}}>Sklearn </span></a><span style={{fontWeight: "400"}}>is a modern machine learning library written in Python.&nbsp;</span></p>
            <br />
            <p><span style={{fontWeight: "400"}}>The best thing about sklearn is that most of the Machine learning algorithms are written for you already. It has a lot of useful classes for preprocessing your data for further analysis</span></p>
            <br />
            <h4>Step 2: Learn Linear Algebra</h4>
            <br />
            <p><span style={{fontWeight: "400"}}>You should learn Linear Algebra if you wish to master Machine Learning and become a pro!</span></p>
            <br />
            <p><span style={{fontWeight: "400"}}>This is essential because if you want to tune your models with maximum flexibility, you need to know how they work, and knowing linear algebra is a must for that!</span></p>
            <br />
            <p><span style={{fontWeight: "400"}}>When you start, you should focus on Step 1, and while you are following step 1, you can begin learning Linear Algebra parallelly. This is what I call the parallel conquering technique.</span></p>
            <br />
            <p><span style={{fontWeight: "400"}}>You start two similar things parallelly, focusing on the first and keeping relatively less priority on the other tasks. This can help you keep the enthusiasm and the motivation up.</span></p>
            <br />
            <p><span style={{fontWeight: "400"}}>One of the resources I found very helpful for revisiting linear algebra concepts was this </span><a href="http://www.maths.qmul.ac.uk/~pjc/notes/linalg.pdf"><span style={{fontWeight: "400"}}>pdf notes.</span></a></p>
            <br />
            <h4>Step 3: Learn Statistics</h4>
            <br />
            <p><span style={{fontWeight: "400"}}>Having a basic understanding of probability and statistics is important when it comes to mastering Machine Learning.&nbsp;</span></p>
            <br />
            <p><span style={{fontWeight: "400"}}>Here is one of the best resources for that: </span><a href="https://www.mathsbox.org.uk/twi/astats.pdf"><span style={{fontWeight: "400"}}>Statistics Revision Notes by MathBox</span></a></p>
            <br />
            <h4>Step 4: Learn Core ML Algorithms</h4>
            <br />
            <p><span style={{fontWeight: "400"}}>Once you have some idea of using sklearn after learning python, you should start looking into how these machine learning algorithms work.&nbsp;</span></p>
            <br />
            <p><span style={{fontWeight: "400"}}>While using sklearn, an ML Algorithm is a black box written by the sklearn developers.</span></p>
            <br />
            <p><span style={{fontWeight: "400"}}>In order to get an idea of how these Machine learning algorithms work from within, look into:</span></p>
            <br />
            <ul>
<li style={{fontWeight: "400"}}><span style={{fontWeight: "400"}}>Gradient Descent</span></li>
<li style={{fontWeight: "400"}}><span style={{fontWeight: "400"}}>Slope</span></li>
<li style={{fontWeight: "400"}}><span style={{fontWeight: "400"}}>Supervised vs Unsupervised learning</span></li>

<li style={{fontWeight: "400"}}><span style={{fontWeight: "400"}}>Clustering</span></li>
</ul>
<br />
<p><span style={{fontWeight: "400"}}>An amazing resource to learn about all this is a book called<a href="https://www.amazon.in/Hands-Machine-Learning-Scikit-Learn-Tensor/dp/9352139054/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2ZIGJ7RDJBZYA&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=hands+on+ml+with+scikit+learn%2C+keras+and+tensorflow&amp;qid=1611033246&amp;sprefix=hands+on+ml%2Ccomputers%2C305&amp;sr=8-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> “Hands-on ML with Scikit learn and tensorflow.”</a> (Not an affiliate link)</span></p>
<br />
<p><span style={{fontWeight: "400"}}>Try to grab a copy of this book. It will help you a lot.&nbsp;</span></p>
<br />
<p><span style={{fontWeight: "400"}}>There are few other resources too that are worth looking into:</span></p>
<br />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course">ML Course from Google</a></li>
<li><a href="https://madewithml.com">madewithml.com</a></li>

<h5>How to read a book</h5>
<br />
<ul>
<li style={{fontWeight: "400"}}><span style={{fontWeight: "400"}}>Schedule your reading time</span></li>
<li style={{fontWeight: "400"}}><span style={{fontWeight: "400"}}>Try to turn the pages and look for exercise-questions</span></li>
<li style={{fontWeight: "400"}}><span style={{fontWeight: "400"}}>Now try to find the answers to those questions while reading</span></li>
<li style={{fontWeight: "400"}}><span style={{fontWeight: "400"}}>These are the points author of the book wants your focus on</span></li>
<li style={{fontWeight: "400"}}><span style={{fontWeight: "400"}}>Try to use read-aloud feature of Microsoft edge. It works pretty well</span></li>
</ul>
<br />
<h4>Step 5: Learn Python Libraries</h4>
<br />
<ul>
<li style={{fontWeight: "400"}}><span style={{fontWeight: "400"}}>Learn Numpy</span></li>
<li style={{fontWeight: "400"}}><span style={{fontWeight: "400"}}>Learn Pandas</span></li>

</ul>
<br />
<p><span style={{fontWeight: "400"}}>To host your machine learning models with a powerful backend, you will need to learn frameworks like Django and Flask.</span></p>
<br />
<p><span style={{fontWeight: "400"}}>Docker and Kubernetes can be of great help if you want to ship and deploy your models quickly!</span></p>
<br />
<p><span style={{fontWeight: "400"}}>Streamlit is worthy of looking into if you wish to build custom web apps for machine learning and data science</span></p>
